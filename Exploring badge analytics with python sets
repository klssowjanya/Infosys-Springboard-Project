Ques:1
Two distinct courses have student enrollments. Develop sets for each course and identify students who are concurrently enrolled in both courses.
Students in Course A: ["Alice", "Bob", "Carol", "David"] Students in Course B: ["Bob", "David", "Eve", "Frank"]
Construct sets for both Course A and Course B as course_a_students and course_b_students. Subsequently, ascertain the students who are enrolled in both courses as common_students.
Ans:
  course_a_students = {"Alice", "Bob", "Carol", "David"}

Ques:2
Keyword lists from two separate articles are provided. Establish sets for each article's keywords and identify the distinctive keywords utilized in both articles.
Keywords in Article 1: ["data", "analysis", "Python", "statistics"] Keywords in Article 2: ["machine learning", "Python", "data", "programming"]
Generate sets for the keywords in both articles, denoting them as article1_keywords and article2_keywords. Determine the unique keywords utilized in both articles and designate them as unique_keywords.
Ans:
  article1_keywords = {"data", "analysis", "Python", "statistics"}
  article2_keywords = {"machine learning", "Python", "data", "programming"}
  unique_keywords = article1_keywords.symmetric_difference(article2_keywords)


Ques:3
Two distinct sources have provided email addresses. Construct sets for each source's email addresses and uncover the unique email addresses encompassing both sources.
Email addresses from Source A: ["alice@example.com", "bob@example.com", "carol@example.com"] Email addresses from Source B: ["carol@example.com", "david@example.com", "eve@example.com"]
Formulate sets for the email addresses in both sources, labeling them as sourceA_emails and sourceB_emails. Store your result in unique_emails.
Ans:
  sourceA_emails = {"alice@example.com", "bob@example.com", "carol@example.com"}
  sourceB_emails = {"carol@example.com", "david@example.com", "eve@example.com"}
  unique_emails = sourceA_emails.union(sourceB_emails)

Ques:10
Find students with badges in Data Explorer, Problem Solver, and Data Ninja categories and store the result in a variable named data_explorer_problem_solver_data_ninja.
Ans:
  data_explorer_problem_solver_data_ninja = data_explorer_badge.intersection(problem_solver_badge, data_ninja_badge)


Ques:11
Find students with Data Novice and Data Detective badges, but not both and store the result in a variable named data_novice_xor_data_detective.
Ans:
  data_novice_xor_data_detective = data_novice_badge.symmetric_difference(data_detective_badge)

  else:
      print("No, `Data Detective` badge is not a subset of `Insight Seeker` badge")


Ques:13
Perform an update on the Trend Tracker badge set by including students who hold both the Problem Solver and Data Ninja badges. Transfer these common students to the Trend Tracker badge.
Make sure you only add the students to Trend Tracker, do not remove them from any badge.
Ans:
  trend_tracker_badge.update(problem_solver_badge.intersection(data_ninja_badge))


Ques:14
Determine the student with the shortest and longest name within the "Data Novice" badge set.
Provide your response in the box below, separating the shortest student's name from the longest student's name using a comma. For instance: Ella, Maria.
There are multiple names for longest name, you have to write name which comes first in alphabetical order.
Ans:
  shortest_name = min(data_novice_badge, key=len)
  longest_names = [name for name in data_novice_badge if len(name) == len(max(data_novice_badge, key=len))]
  # Display the results
  print(f"Shortest Name: {shortest_name}")
  print(f"Longest Names: {', '.join(longest_names)}")
  Here, for the largest name we used list comprehension iterates through each name in data_novice_badge. It checks if the length of the name is equal to the length of the maximum length name in data_novice_badge 
  If true, it includes that name in longest_names. This ensures that all names with the maximum length are included.
